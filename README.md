# SMS Video Converter v1.0

A command-line Python utility that batch converts video files or single file into **DviX format** that [PS2 Simple Media System](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/SMS) supports, using `ffmpeg`, with optional cropping, subtitle burning (internal or external), and real-time progress monitoring.

This was inspired by following Reddit posts:

## ❗ Notes
- In my testing, a video bitrate of 2000–3000 kbps strikes a good balance between picture quality and smooth playback when playing from USB devices.
- Cropping is only applied if the original video is wider than standard 4:3 ratio.
- Subtitles can be burned only if a valid stream or external file is found.
